Creating an Etsy clone for learning! <br>
Etsy is a famous DIY crafts store, where it's sold crafts or DIY patterns made by users, sometimes even materials. It contains a wide array of craft types, from knitting and crochet to wood carving. <br>

# Technology
Developed with Vue.js, Typescript and Tailwind. <br>
Icons are from fontawesome.


### Notes
Resposivity isn't being taken care of yet but will be in the future. The development screen size was 1920 x 1080 <br>
Tests done are examples for now, test coverage for the whole project is being considered.
